[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/642486e0-3ff0-4cff-a424-2289765310ce/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/traversy-styled/deploys) \
A training Front End project for creating a responsive landing page using Styled Components - https://youtu.be/02zO0hZmwnw

#### A few benefits of the styled-components library are:

- It’s plain CSS. Yes, you’re writing the CSS in a JS file, but the CSS syntax is unchanged.
- Vendor prefixes are automatically added when using Styled Components, improving performance across browsers.
- All unused CSS and styling gets removed automatically
- You don’t write any class names, whatsoever. Class names are generated automatically, so there’s no need to manage a CSS class naming methodology like BEM. (This’ll make more sense as you go through the article)

## Technologies used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) single page application
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - a strongly typed programming language
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) styling

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and install the dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

2. Start the frontend application locally

```bash
yarn start
```
