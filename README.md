# React Responsive Landing Page

A training Front End project for creating a responsive landing page using Styled Components - a “CSS-in-JS” solution. It’s an extremely popular solution for managing CSS in React, with around 8 million npm downloads/month and 30k stars in Github. YouTube - [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA).

#### A few benefits of the styled-components library are:

- It’s plain CSS. Yes, you’re writing the CSS in a JS file, but the CSS syntax is unchanged.
- Vendor prefixes are automatically added when using Styled Components, improving performance across browsers.
- All unused CSS and styling gets removed automatically
- You don’t write any class names, whatsoever. Class names are generated automatically, so there’s no need to manage a CSS class naming methodology like BEM. (This’ll make more sense as you go through the article)
